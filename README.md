# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

This repo is me documenting my way through the DataTalks Club DE zoomcamp.  I hope others find my notes useful.  I'm taking a different approach to the project.  I started late with very little chance I'll make the deadline but there is still value in completing the course.  

My work may not line up perfectly with the course because I'm trying to do as much of the work on my own.  This invloves using the command line as much as possible and I include those commands in my notes.

This repo will contain a folder for each week and each folder will have at least one readme with notes for the week.  The aim was not just copy the course repo but note things that casued me grief and how I proceeded.

I will update this as I go.

I'm through the pipeline porion of the course and I'm gonna jump to some other stuff that has taken priority.

Feel free to email me if you need any help with the first 5 weeks of this project.

### Week 4

- Highly recommend going to dbt and signing up for their free [course account](https://courses.getdbt.com/collections).  It will make week 4 go real smooth for you.
- I would do at least the first two:
  - dbt fundamentals
  - Jinja, macros and packages
- Get a sweet badge to show everyone you're now a dbt jinja ninja.
